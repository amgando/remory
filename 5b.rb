# story (defect): as a user I can re-enter a cleared position and the board resets that position
# story (defect): as a user I can re-enter a flipped position and the board clears that position

# (after some investigation, these stories are likely related)

# acceptance criteria (fixed):
# - I can re-enter a cleared position and nothing changes on the board
# - I can re-enter a flipped position and nothing changes on the board
