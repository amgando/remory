### An Introduction to Ruby

Welcome to Remory, a simple console game based on this [memory game](http://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-4263-Original-Memory/dp/B00000IWDD).

The goal of this project is to introduce complete beginners to the fun of writing a Ruby program in small, reasonable steps.

The files in this project are organized into a series of numbered files:

- `1.rb`: the beginning of a game, we can play 1 round
- `2.rb`: we use a loop to play more than 1 round
- `2b.rb`: we fix 2 bugs related to our input
- `3.rb`: a message is displayed when we pick 2 cards 
- `4.rb`: message changes depending on whether or not the cards match
- `5.rb`: cards are cleared if they match and reset if they don't
- `5b.rb`: we fix another bug related to our input
- `5r.rb`: refactor some verbose code into something more elegant
- `6.rb`: finally, the game ends!
- `7.rb`: we track how many attempts it took to complete the game
